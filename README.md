# Welcome to the Load Simulator

This tool is designed to stochastically predict electricity demand in rural microgrids. Users can input individual device utilisation profiles to build load profiles from the bottom up. The profiles are simple and easy to integrate into energy system models such as HOMER and CLOVER.
