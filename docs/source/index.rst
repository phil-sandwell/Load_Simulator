Load_Simulator documentation
==========================================
Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Load_Simulator is designed to stochastically
predict electricity demand in rural microgrids. Users can input individual
device utilisation profiles to build load profiles from the bottom up. The
profiles are simple and easy to integrate into energy system models such as
HOMER and CLOVER.
